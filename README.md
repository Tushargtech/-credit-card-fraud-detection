# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques with a complete pipeline — from data preprocessing to real-time prediction using Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system capable of identifying rare but critical fraudulent transactions. Using real-world data, we address class imbalance using SMOTE and train high-performance models like Random Forest and XGBoost. The final model is integrated into a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.
